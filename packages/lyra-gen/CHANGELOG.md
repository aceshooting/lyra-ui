# Changelog

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- c8fab8e: Establish the 1.x compatibility contract for constrained generated views, interactive chat, saved and live dashboards, static semantic SSR, and the documented SDK and protocol profiles. The A2UI candidate artifact entry remains experimental. Replace wildcard imports with the documented explicit entry points; supported public imports remain available.

  Add deterministic Markets, Weather, and Travel Budget walkthroughs with authored prompts, streamed replies, follow-up actions, cancellation, and replay. Expand input-route, localization, restoration, declaration, and packed-example checks, and add reproducible browser performance and memory qualification tools. These examples require no model credentials and do not claim provider quality or token-cost results.

## 0.1.0

Initial experimental release. The package guides document the supported profiles and
qualification limits.

- Restricted Lyra Markup and JSON input, reviewed catalogs, schemas, diagnostics and bounded parsing.
- Incremental generated views, local and controlled form state, host-authorized actions and repairs.
- Chat integration, replay tooling and portable dashboard, revision and host-persistence contracts.
- Keyboard focus return after host approval cancellation, preserving focus deliberately moved elsewhere.
- Live-dashboard selection binds to loaded chart and table controls, including delayed role loaders.
- Versioned A2UI processing with explicit capability limits and independent protocol fixtures.

The package does not provide model credentials, a hosted generation service, application identity
or a production dashboard database. Stored definitions have explicit versions and must be validated
against the host's selected catalog before use.
