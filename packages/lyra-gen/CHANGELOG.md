# Changelog

## 0.1.0

Initial experimental release. The package guides document the supported profiles and
qualification limits.

- Restricted Lyra Markup and JSON input, reviewed catalogs, schemas, diagnostics and bounded parsing.
- Incremental generated views, local and controlled form state, host-authorized actions and repairs.
- Chat integration, replay tooling and portable dashboard, revision and host-persistence contracts.
- Keyboard focus return after host approval cancellation, preserving focus deliberately moved elsewhere.
- Versioned A2UI processing with explicit capability limits and independent protocol fixtures.

The package does not provide model credentials, a hosted generation service, application identity
or a production dashboard database. Stored definitions have explicit versions and must be validated
against the host's selected catalog before use.
